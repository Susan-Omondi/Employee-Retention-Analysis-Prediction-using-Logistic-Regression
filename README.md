# Employee-Retention-Analysis-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Employee retention is a critical challenge for organizations. This project analyzes employee data to understand the key factors that influence whether an employee leaves a company or stays, and builds a Logistic Regression model to predict employee attrition.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns related to:
- Job satisfaction
- Workload
- Salary levels
- Promotions
- Departmental trends
- 
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory analysis was performed to identify variables that have a clear impact on employee retention.

Key Findings:
- Employees with low satisfaction levels are far more likely to leave
- Low salary employees show higher attrition rates
- Employees with no promotions in the last 5 years are more likely to leave
- Certain departments (e.g., Sales, Technical) experience higher turnover
- Extremely high or low working hours correlate with higher attrition

# Machine Learning Model
A Logistic Regression model was used since the target variable (left) is binary.
Selected Features:
- satisfaction_level
- average_montly_hours
- promotion_last_5years
  
# Visual Analysis
The following visualizations were created:
- Salary vs Employee Retention (bar chart)
- Department vs Employee Retention (bar chart)
- These charts clearly show how compensation and department affect employee turnover.
